# Financial Tracker

## Description of the Project

Financial Tracker is a Java console application that helps users manage their personal finances. Users can add deposits, make payments, view transaction history through a ledger, and generate simple reports. It's designed for individuals who want a lightweight way to track their income and expenses without a complex interface.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see a main menu with clear options, so that I know what actions I can take.
- As a user, I want to see an option to add a deposit in the menu, so that I can record money added to my account.
- As a user, I want to see an option to make a payment in the menu, so that I can record money spent or withdrawn.
- As a user, I want to access reports from the ledger, so that I can run summaries and searches.
- As a user, I want to filter transactions by date, so that I can review activity during a selected period.
- As a user, I want to search for transactions by vendor, so that I can quickly find related expenses or income.
- As a user, I want to use a custom search so that I can specifically filter through my transactions based on criteria I choose.
- As a user, I want to have an exit option in the menu, so I can close the application when Iâ€™m finished.
